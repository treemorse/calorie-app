## Introduction
The Calorie Counter Application is designed to assist users in accurately estimating the caloric content of their meals through the analysis of food photographs. This application utilizes advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to identify various food items, estimate their weights, and compute the corresponding calorie content.

### Objectives
- Develop a user-centric mobile application for calorie counting.
- Implement sophisticated machine learning models for food recognition and weight estimation.
- Provide accurate and reliable calorie estimates to support users in maintaining a healthy diet.
